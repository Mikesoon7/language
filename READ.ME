Hello friends! If somehow you've reached my repo and checked my 
pet-Project, please, share your ideas 'bout what was/could be done in the 
more proper way.

By the way, first commit wasn't good, because there is a lot of trash code, 
which more like an experiment, than a part of whole project.I'll deal with 
it at the next commit.
